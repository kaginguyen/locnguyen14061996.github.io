Nowadays, there is such a huge interest in data and how magical it is in pushing companies, which can use it, toward success over competitors. The interest keeps growing even though most people dont actually know it. It is like the Bitcoin bubble, the moment Bitcoin's price reach 1,000 USD, people start wondering about it and it does not take it long until people chase after it and the whole market rises up to the top of the moutain, before falling hard.

Same thing is happening to the data-using industry, many people know about it but actually don't really understand clearly on it. Thats why I want to write an article in order to explain a little bit about how to at least understand the title of a data-user and to not be confussed on what they are supposed to do.
