Nowadays, there is such a huge interest in data and how magical it is in pushing companies, which can use it, toward success over competitors. The interest keeps growing even though most people dont actually understand how it actually is. It is like the Bitcoin bubble, the moment Bitcoin's price reach 1,000 USD, people start wondering about it and it does not take it long until people chase after it and the whole market rises up to the top of the moutain, before falling hard.

<p align="center" style="font-size: 70%;"> Bitcoin's price start raising steadily after reaching 1000 USD.</p>

Same thing is happening to the data-using industry, many people know about it but actually don't really understand clearly on it. Thats why I want to write an article in order to explain a little bit about how to at least understand the title of a data-user and to not be confussed on what they are supposed to do.

Now I will list down some the most famous titles, which includes some you may have heard a lot before, and after that, I will go on to explain them separately: 

1. Data Scientist
2. Machine Learning (AI)  Researcher/Engineer
3. (Big) Data Engineer
4. Data Analyst
5. Business Analyst
6. Business Data Analyst 


Through time, some of the explanation can change drastically so I may make some mistakes, therefore, make sure to see the Updated time at the end of the article to see when is the last time I update this list. Without waiting further, let's dive right in!!!
